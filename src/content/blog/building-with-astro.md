Astro is a modern web framework that's designed for building fast, content-focused websites. Here's why it's great for blogs.

## Zero JS by Default

Astro ships zero JavaScript to the browser by default. This means faster page loads and better performance for your readers.

## Content Collections

Content collections provide type-safe frontmatter and make it easy to work with your content:

```typescript
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
```

## Flexible

You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework alongside Astro's component syntax. Use the right tool for each job.

## Developer Experience

With features like hot module reloading, TypeScript support, and excellent documentation, Astro makes development enjoyable.
